Description: This package provides abstract RPC (Remote Procedure Call) structure for higher level of robot operations for the ROS-based robots.
 Some ROS-based robots come with higher level of convenient operation interface (e.g. often written in Python) where robot operators can call complicated tasks by a single command. &quot;RPC&quot; here enables interacting with those commands via ROS Topic/Service/Action from remote nodes.
