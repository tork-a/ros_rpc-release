%description
This package provides abstract RPC (Remote Procedure Call) structure for higher
level of robot operations for the ROS-based robots. Some ROS-based robots come
with higher level of convenient operation interface (e.g. often written in
Python) where robot operators can call complicated tasks by a single command.
&quot;RPC&quot; here enables interacting with those commands via ROS
Topic/Service/Action from remote nodes.
